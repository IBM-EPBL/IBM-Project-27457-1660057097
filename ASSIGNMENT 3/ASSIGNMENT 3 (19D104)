ASSIGNMENT 3
TASK ASSIGNED:
Write a python code for blinking LED and Traffic lights for Raspberry Pi.

PYTHON CODE FOR BLINKING LED:
from gpiozero import Button,LED
from time import sleep
button = Button(21)
led=LED(25)
while True:
led.blink()
button.wait_for_press()
led.off()
button.wait_for_release()
○ Run the code and you’ll see the LED blink on and off until the button
is pressed, at which point it will turn off completely. When the button
is released, it will start blinking again.
○ Try adding some parameters to blink to make it blink faster or slower:
○ led.blink(2, 2) - 2 seconds on, 2 seconds off
○ led.blink(0.5, 0.5) - half a second on, half a second off

PYTHON CODE FOR TRAFFIC LIGHTS:
from gpiozero import Button,TrafficLights,Buzzer
from time import sleep
button = Button(21)
lights=TrafficLights(25,8,7)
buzzer=Buzzer(15)
while True:
lights.green.on()#pin 25
sleep(1)
lights.amber.on()#pin 8
sleep(1)
lights.red.on()#pin 7
sleep(1)
lights.off()
